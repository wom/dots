Dot Files. On *nix; to setup run
```bash
-> git clone <dots>
-> cd <dots>
-> ./symScript.sh
```
* NeoVim will need a bit more setup after; though it's being cleaned up slowely over time.

```bash
-> cd <dots>/.config/nvim
-> make install # bootstrap self. Still needs #:TSInstall python...
```
- NeoVim still needs Node, RipGrep, and a few other host apps for full functionality.

* Starship prompt
- Install from https://starship.rs
